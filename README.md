🏨 Hospitality Booking Analytics Dashboard (2024–2025) | Excel + Power Query + Power BI




📌 Project Overview:

Analyzed and visualized hotel booking data from 2024–2025 to uncover patterns in revenue, customer behavior, and booking trends. Leveraged Excel and Power Query to clean, transform, and extract actionable insights from a hospitality dataset with a focus on dynamic pricing, occupancy, and guest experience optimization.

- Standardized date formats for Check_In and Check_Out.




🔄 Feature Engineering:

- Extracted Year, Month, Week No, Quarter, Day, Weekday/Weekend from Check_In.

- Classified bookings into ‘Weekday’ or ‘Weekend’ to distinguish between business and leisure stays.
